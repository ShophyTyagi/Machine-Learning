# Machine-Learning
### Activity 1 - Data Preprocessing 
In this notebook, I learn the very basics of data cleaning which is dealing with missing values. The aim is to understand how to approach raw data. 

### Activity 2 - Data Visualization 
Here I learn how to plot graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The idea of this activity is to understand how to approach the data visualization concept. 

### Activity 3 - Simple Linear Regression 
In this notebook I learn Simple Linear Regression in depth. I cover the concept of applying the model and then evaluating it using different methods. The idea was to understand the theory and then coming up with the algorithm using multiple methods. The methods I use are 
* Least Squares
* Sci-kit Learn
* Stats Model
* Gradient Descent

### Avtivity 4 - Multiple Linear Regression 
In this activity I learn in depth about Multiple Linear Regression. I use multiple methods to apply the algorithm and then evaluate those methods. The methods I use are 
* Sci-kit Learn
* Backward Selection
* Gradient Descent

### Activity 5 - Logistic Regression 
This activity is to learn the theory and the maths behind Logistic Regression. I use 3 different ways to implement the algorithm, these methods are 
* Gradient Descent
* Sci-kit Learn
* Statsmodels
